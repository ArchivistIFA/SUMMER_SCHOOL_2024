### **2.1 Introduction to DCPs**

DCPs aka Digital Cinema Packages were the standardised replacement to analogue film projection, introduced circa 2010. JPEG-2000 and WAV components in an MXF wrapper, with an emphasis on lockability and security (due to piracy conerns). 2K (common) or 4K (rare) resolution with a limited range of framerates.

Interesting sidenote, `Film Curatorship (Usai, Francis, Horwath, Loebenstein)` from 2008 posits a likely arms-race on resolution necitating constant format upgrades, *this did not happen*. 

We now live in a world where people watch 8K televsion in there homes on a screen this big, but pay 20 bucks to watch 2K on a screen this big. Crazy.

### **2.1 Introduction to DCPs**

If we want to desseminate our media to be projected in a cinema context we will want the ability to create our own DCPs.

Today we will look at two tools, DCP-o-matic to create the distributable package, and ClairMeta to validate our package.

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**


DCP-o-matic has a nice graphical application, but today we are going to stay with the command line version. 

Why?

Because if you can use the command line version, you can automate creation - for example, make DCPs of these forty projects, or even make a DCP by default for every film scan.

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**

Check DCP-o-matic is installed

```sh
dcpomatic2_create -v
```

Create a DCP

```sh
dcpomatic2_create -o test_dcp --container-ratio 185 --content-ratio 185 -c SHR -n "Test DCP" DIRECTORY
```

dcpomatic2_create -o test_dcp --container-ratio 185 -c SHR -n "TEST DCP" ~/nicht_ohne_uns/



dcpomatic2_cli test_dcp # work off the video created file


Step through the options used:
-o is the output directory
--container-ratio 185 is the aspect ratio
-c is the short code for what type of material it is FTR for Feature, SHR for Short, TLR for Trailer.
-n is the title of the work
and where the file or files live

tour of created package
