### **2. DCPs**

class: contentpage
### **2.1 Introduction to DCPs**

DCPs aka Digital Cinema Packages were the standardised replacement to analogue film projection, introduced circa 2010. JPEG-2000 and WAV components in an MXF wrapper, with an emphasis on lockability and security (due to piracy conerns). 2K (common) or 4K (rare) resolution with a limited range of framerates.

Interesting sidenote, `Film Curatorship (Usai, Francis, Horwath, Loebenstein)` from 2008 posits a likely arms-race on resolution necessitating constant format upgrades, and making stable formats for archives difficult to collect. *This did not happen*, likely due to the effort required to physically update the digital projectors, and no motivations equivalent to the physical/digital changeover.  

We now live in a world where some people watch 8K televsion in their homes on a screen this big, but also pay 20 bucks to watch 2K projected on a screen this big. Crazy.

### **2.1 Introduction to DCPs**

If we want to disseminate our media to be projected in a cinema context, we will need the ability to create our own DCPs.

Today we will look at two tools, DCP-o-matic to create the distributable package and ClairMeta to validate our package.

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**


DCP-o-matic has a nice graphical application, but today we are going to stay with the command line version. 

Why?

Because if you can use the command line version, you can automate creation - for example, make DCPs of these forty projects, or even make a DCP by default for every film scan.

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**

Check DCP-o-matic is installed

```sh
dcpomatic2_create -v
```

Creating a DCP has two stages, "create" only creates the recipe for what we are requesting.

```sh
dcpomatic2_create -o test_dcp --container-ratio 185 -c SHR -n "Test DCP" ~/Desktop/summer-school-2024/media/dpx/
```

This is expressed as a `metadata.xml` document.

```sh
cat metadata.xml 
```

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**

Some notes on what the creation options used here are:     
`-o test_dcp` this is the directory where the DCP will be created.     
`--container-ratio 185` this is our aspect ratio.     
`-c SHR` SHR is the code for "short". There is also FTR (feature), TLR (trailer) and others.     
`-n "Test DCP"` this is the title of our DCP.     
`~/Desktop/summer-school-2024/media/dpx/` this is where the source media can be found.    

As should now be a common pattern, all other options can be found using "--help"
```sh
dcpomatic2_create --help
```

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**


We action the action creation of the DCP using the following command.

```sh
dcpomatic2_cli test_dcp
```

This will think for a short time (question time!), and then we can have a look at the resulting files.

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**

Under our test_dcp folder we should now see a folder like `TestDcp_SHR-1_F-178_XX-XX_MOS_2K_20240914_SMPTE_OV`.

This is our DCP! You can put this on a hard drive and send to your local cinema.

I love the fact that there is also a `cover_sheet.txt` autogenerated, which contains the technical information required for the projectionist.

### **2.2 Creating DCPs with DCP-o-matic**

Before we send it out though, we would want to validate it, to make sure there are no issues with the files.

### **2.3 DCP validation with ClairMeta**

ClairMeta is an opensource tool to check DCPs are valid, which can be used as an external Python library.

```python
import pathlib
from clairmeta import DCP

dcp = DCP(pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'test_dcp' / 'TestDcp_SHR-1_F-178_XX-XX_MOS_2K_20240914_SMPTE_OV')
dcp.parse()
status, report = dcp.check()
```

This will deliver a report, with a headline status of either "Success" or "Failure".

We can experiment with forcing a failure.

### **2.3 DCP validation with ClairMeta**

Combining tools like Python and ClairMeta can become really powerful, for example say you have 500 DCPs in your collection and you want to validate them all.

Manual verification would be tedious, and take a great deal of time, but with these tools this becomes much easier.

We will explore this concept in more detail tomorrow.
