class: contentpage
### **Agenda 1**

Introduction to Open Source  
> 1.1 The four freedoms  
> 1.2 Source code  
> 1.3 Evaluating projects  
> 1.4 Support models

### **1. Introduction to Open Source**

Open source software is often thought of as free to use, but to be classified as Open a project must meet four criteria for its users.
---
class: contentpage
### **1.1 The Four Freedoms**

- __Freedom to run the programme how you like for any purpose__  

- __Freedom to study how the programme works, and make changes for your own use__  

- __Freedom to redistribute copies of the original programme to whoever you like__  

- __Freedom to redistribute copies of your modified version to whoever you like__  
  
An open source project should provide you with information about the type of licence that governs the use of it.  
Advice about open source licences can be found at the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses)
---
class: contentpage
### **1.2 Source code**

You also need to access the source code. The licence will permit you to make your own copy of the software, to edit and redistribute. Mostly youâ€™ll find source code in Git repositories, like you see here for the FFmpeg libraries.

### **1.3 Evaluating projects**  

1. Can you avoid adding it? Can you use existing dependencies or software already installed?  
   *Every new piece of software comes with dependencies and potential security issue.Answer: No, this piece of software is unique in how it losslessly compresses and preserves image sequences.*

2. Are you evaluating the correct version and not a fork of a project?  
   *There should be an official download site with the latest verion with links to their repositories. Check the website name is exactly correct and the project website link is correct.*  

3. If searching for a project, or following a recommendation, do you have the latest version of the software?  
   *Projects can move, as development teams or hosting shifts. Check the late release date and popularity of the repository. Recent releases and active users points to official released code.*

4. Is the project maintained? Has there been significant recent activity and version releases? Are they supporting user issues?
   *Take a look a the issues raised by users and whether they have been successfully resolved, and see how recent these conversations occurred.*

Further guidelines are available from the [Open Source Security Foundation](https://best.openssf.org/Concise-Guide-for-Evaluating-Open-Source-Software.html) 
---
class: contentpage
### **1.4 Support models**  

**Funded models**  

- Bounty driven development  
  _Independent developers receive bounty payments for feature development or bug fixes_  

- User support contracts  
  _Paid for support contracts help secure regular income for project developers_  

- Consulting or expertise  
  _Experienced developers charge for consultation work_  

- Mixed licensing  
  _Software offers free to use options, but others may require payment_  

- Grants and donations  
  _Payment for development of specific tools, grant funding or gifts_  


---
class: contentpage
### **1.4 Support models**  

**User support models**  
   
- Writing or editing documentation  
  _Save time for developers to work on code and not documentation_  

- Language translations  
  _Make the code more accessible for international users_  

- Supporting other users  
  _Peer to peer support saves developers time with basic enquiries_  

- Bug finding and testing software  
  _More user testing helps make the project more robust_  

- Promoting and fundraising  
  _Blogging about your use of software, helping raise money for developers_

### TUE01: *Intro to the Command Line and Bash*
---
class: contentpage
### **Agenda 2**

Command Line Interface (CLI)   
> 2.1 Unix Terminal  
> 2.2 Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or PowerShell  
> 2.3 Unix tools on Windows  
> 2.4 Useful tools and commands  

Bash shell scripting 
> 2.5 Special characters and comparisons   
> 2.6 Loops and conditional statements  
> 2.7 Shebang and script formation  
> 2.8 Running and testing code

---
class: contentpage
### **2. Command Line Interface (CLI)**

The Command Line Interface is a text only window set into a Graphical User Interface (or GUI).

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/2021-02-27_-_ffmpeg_version.gif" width="800">]
---
class: contentpage
### **2. Command Line Interface (CLI)**
 
A command is an instruction telling the computer how to act, like asking which FFmpeg version is installed  
```sh
ffmpeg -version (Unix / Windows)
```

A CLI has a command interpreter (or shell) running within it converting our typed command lines into a language the computer can understand  
  
As you type in a command (echo) with arguments ('Hello World') the shell interpreter reads and executes them  
```sh
echo 'Hello World' (Unix)
```

The CLI displays the command you type as well as the result of the command shown below
```sh
echo $0 (Unix)
```
This example of echo is asking the CLI to print out which version of shell is being used, - eg `bash` or `/bin/bash`  
---
class: contentpage
### **2. Command Line Interface (CLI)**

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Parrot.gif" width="300">]
```bash
curl parrot.live
```

**Why would you want to use the command line?**

- To learn amazing new things like running Party Parrot!
- To install and run open source software   
- To use open source software projects that have limited or no graphical user interface  
- To run CPU intensive processes in the background while still running day to day software  
- To work remotely with servers or virtual machines over networks or in data centres  
- To build automated processes and operate more efficiently ðŸ‘€  

---
class: contentpage
### **2.1 Linux and MacOS Terminal (Unix)**

Macintosh and Linux have the same operating system (OS) - Unix. Unix operating systems all use the Terminal CLI.

To launch Terminal in Mac OS:
```Bash
Cmd + Space  (and search 'Terminal')
``` 
To launch a Terminal in Linux OS:
```Bash
Ctl + Alt + T
```
Use the `chsh` command with the `-s` shell flag, followed by the argument `/bin/bash/` to change to Bash:  
```Bash
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

To check what version of Bash you are running you can use this command:  
```Bash
bash --version
```

---
class: contentpage
### **2.2 Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or PowerShell**

To launch a CLI in Windows Console click `Start`, and in the search:
```Powershell
cmd (Command Prompt)   Powershell   Windows Terminal
```  
**Command Prompt (cmd or cmd.exe)**  
 The default CLI for older Windows Systems, including Windows 9x and Windows NT  
  
**Powershell**  
Powershell is an automated command-line shell with Command Prompt features.  
  
**Windows Terminal**  
Windows 10 launched the Windows Terminal in 2019, which provides a choice of interpreters including:  
- `Command Prompt - cmd.exe`  
- `Powershell`  
- `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`  

[Comparison of Command Shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_command_shells) 
---
class: contentpage
### **2.3 Unix tools on Windows**

Window Subsystem for Linux (WSL) v1 is supported in Windows 10, 11 and Windows Server 2016, 2019 and 2022.
WSL v2 has a full Linux kernel and is available in Windows 10 via the [Windows Insider Programme](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/learn-how-to-install-wsl-2).

[Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl)

For Windows machine that don't have WSL:

- [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) has a large collection of open source software tools described as 'Unix like'
  
- [GNU On Windows (GOW)](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/wiki) contains over 100 'extremely useful open source Unix applications'

### **2.4 Useful commands and tools (Unix and Windows)**

<font color="black">Short cut!</font> Press the control button with the letters above to perform shell functions: 
```sh
Ctl+C | Ctl+A                 | Ctl+E               | Ctl+B                 | Ctl+F         | Ctl+H              | Ctl+D
Break | Move to start of line | Move to end of line | Backspace (no delete) | Forward space | Backspace (delete) | Log out of shell
```  
<font color="black">Short cut!</font> Press the tab button can autocomplete a path or command: 
```sh
Tab
```
<font color="black">Command:</font> Print parent working directory to console  
```sh
pwd (Unix) ch chdir (Windows)
```  
<font color="black">Command:</font> List the contents of the current directory  
```sh
ls (Unix) dir (Windows)
```
<font color="black">Command:</font> Make a new directory  
```sh
mkdir <new_directory_name> (Unix/Windows)
```
---
class: tangentpage
### **Tangent: Absolute and relative paths**

Absolute paths always contain the full path to a file or folder from a hard drive:
```sh
/mnt/qnap/folder1/subfolder2/file.txt
C:\Users\User\Documents\file.txt
```
Relative paths are relative to the current working directory of the CLI (pwd/ch is folder1):
```sh
./subfolder2/file.txt
../
~
```  
When naming folders avoid using spaces or special characters:  
```sh
FolderForTest (CamelCase example)
folder_for_test (snake_case example)
```
Spaces in paths can break commands, and like special characters are illegal filename characters. Keep it simple! 
---
class: contentpage
### **2.4 Useful commands and tools (Unix and Windows)**

<font color="black">Command:</font> Change the current directory you are in  
```sh
cd <new_directory_name> (Unix/Windows)

---
class: contentpage
### **2.5 Special characters and comparisons**

Comments can be added anywhere using the hash symbol
```sh
#  -  #Comments here
```
Dollar symbol prefixed names to indicate that there is a value attached and stored in that name  
```sh
$  -  $name, echo $0
```
Indicates a placeholder used in a search command, or for concatenating variables in strings when prefixed with $   
```sh
{}  -  ${PATH}
```
Tests are expressed between square brackets and return boolean reponses 'true' or 'false'  
```sh
[] or [[]]  -  if [ -z "$name" ]
``` 
A semicolon allows you to concatenate two or more commands into one line completing each in turn  
```sh
;  -  echo "Hello";  echo "lovely";  echo 'Archivists!'
```
---
class: contentpage
### **2.5 Special characters and comparisons**

Asterisks serves as a 'wild card' and used on its own it matches all filenames in a given directory  
```sh
*  -  find /path/folder/ -name '*.mkv'
```
The pipe `|` passes the standard output of a previous command, such as `echo` to the input of the next  
```sh
|  -  echo "filename.txt" | rev | cut -c 5-  | rev
```
The `||` OR operator will keep trying commands in a line until one succeeds. The `&&` AND operator will only continue processing commands if they succeed  
```sh
||  &&   -  false || echo 'Hello World!'    false && echo "Hello World"
```
Single quotes `'` preserves all special characters in a string, but always use double quotes `"` for quoting paths  
```sh
"string" or 'string!'
```
Redirects the standard output (stdout) and standard errors (stderr) of a script into a file  
```sh
>  >>  &>  &>> -  echo 'Hello lovely Archivists!' >> test.log
```
---
class: contentpage
### **2.5 Special characters and comparisons**
Arithmetic characters plus, minus, divide. Equals can be used in many ways
```sh
+  -  %  =
```
Equals symbol can be used to populate variables with content, or compare variables match in an `if` test  
```sh
a='string1'
b='string2'
if [ "$a" == "$b" ]
```
String comparisons vs mathematic comparisons:
```sh
string | comparison               | math  
-------|--------------------------|--------
==     | is equal to              | -eq    
!=     | is not equal to          | -ne
<      | is less than             | -lt
>      | is greater than          | -gt
<=     | less than or equal to    | -le
>=     | greater than or equal to | -ge
-n     | string is not empty      | 
-z     | string is empty          |
```

---
class: contentpage
### **2.6 Loops and conditional statements**

The `find` search and `-exec` argument can loop through results performing the same command repeatedly  
```sh
find /mnt/path/folder -type f -name 'N_*' -exec mv {} /mnt/new_path/folder/{} \;
```
For loops will find files in the parent folder, using do and done to control the start and end of a loop  
```sh
for file in *.mov; do mv "$file" "/mnt/new_path/folder/${file}"; done
```
While loops will keep completing a set of tasks until the condition of the loop is no longer met
```sh
while [[ "$counter" > 0 ]]; do echo "${counter}"; counter=$(( counter - 1 )); done
```
Arguments of a conditional construct. Depending on the result of `if` the next is selected
```bash
if  elif   else   fi   then
```
---
class: contentpage
### **2.6 Loops and conditional statements**

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Shell_example.png" width="1400">]
---
class: contentpage
### **2.7 Shebang and script formation**

Create a new shell script simply by making a file with the extension `.sh`

```sh
touch new_script.sh
```

Ensure the permissions of the file will allow you to user to read, write and later execute it 
```bash
chmod u+x new_script.sh
```
Use `-l` to view the permissions of your file before and afeter
```sh
ls -l
```
Open that new file and begin writing your script, there are many editing options including
```sh
nano new_script.sh  (Ctl+X to exit)
vi new_script.sh    (Type :q to exit)
open new_script.sh  (Launches file in GUI)
```
  
---
class: contentpage
### **2.7 Shebang and script formation**

A shebang as your first line provides the shell path for execution
```sh
#! /bin/bash

# Note to say what script does
# Script to check if files in folder and print log to console and $LOG

# Create a variable for the path you want to search
PATH_TO_CHECK="/Users/Joanna/Desktop/test_folder/"

# Create a log variable and use touch to make the file
LOG="${PATH_TO_CHECK}new_log.txt"
touch "$LOG"
cd "$PATH_TO_CHECK"

# Start the for loop searching for any file with an extension use the wild card
# Complete two commands for each file found, print 'Item found: name' to CLI and 
# append the name into the $LOG text file
for file in *.*
do
  echo "Item found: ${file}"
  echo "$file" >> "${LOG}"
done
```

---
class: contentpage
### **2.7 Shebang and script formation**

The same results but this time using the find loop, with a maxdepth setting of 1 to stop it searching in subfolders  
```sh
#! /bin/bash

# Note to say what script does
# Script to check if files in folder and print log to console and $LOG

# Create a variable for the path you want to search
PATH_TO_CHECK="/Users/Joanna/Desktop/test_folder/"

# Create a log variable and use touch to make the file
LOG="${PATH_TO_CHECK}new_log.txt"
touch "${LOG}"

# Start a for loop searching for any file with an extension use the wild card
# Set maxdepth to 1 to stop the search looking in subfolders and only find -type 'f', file
find "${PATH_TO_CHECK}" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.*' -exec echo {} >> "${LOG}" \;  
```

[Shellcheck.net](https://shellcheck.net) is an excellent resource for testing your shell script is correctly formed before running it live 
---
class: contentpage
### **2.8 Running and testing code**

Navigate into the same folder as your script. Call the script prefaced with `./` 
```sh
cd script_directory
./new_script.sh
```
To get traces of each line as it's executed and verbose reporting on script runs use `-x` and `-v` after the shebang  
```bash
#! /bin/bash -x -v
```
You can also use the `test` command which has lots of options for testing your bash commands  
```bash
test -n "$(find "/User/Joanna/Desktop" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.*' -exec echo {} \;)"
echo $?
man test
```
  
Using POSIX standard ensures your shell scripts are portable between different Unix systems:  
[GNU.org Bash-POSIX-Mode](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Bash-POSIX-Mode)

### **3 Introduction to FFmpeg**
.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 21.13.26.png" width="650">]

- FFmpeg encodes, decodes, muxes and demuxes audiovisual file formats at speed  
- It has an extensive list of supported codecs and file formats  
- It's open source software and makes projects like VLC, YouTube and iTunes possible  
- Hundreds of filters that visualise and analyse complex audiovisual data  
- FFmpeg comes with a metadata analysis and extraction tool FFprobe  
- Playback of all FFmpeg formats and codecs and live streams is possible with FFplay  
- It can be used via the CLI, with third party GUIs or via their own API  

---
class: contentpage
### **3.1 The basic FFmpeg command**

This basic FFmpeg video encoding command:
```sh
ffmpeg -i input.mov output.mp4
```
This is also the same for audio files, and image files:  
```sh
ffmpeg -i input.wav output.mp3
ffmpeg -i input.tif output.jpg
```
To select a video or audio stream to select a codec use the following flags:
```sh
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v prores_ks -c:a copy output.mov
```
The input.mkv video will be re-encoded to ProRes and the audio codec will be unchanged in the second command. The wrapper will change from Matroska to MOV.  
---
class: contentpage
### **3.2 Format defaults**

FFmpeg has default codec selections for audio and video if not specified in a command:  

```
Format     | Default video   | Default audio  
-----------|-----------------|----------------
avi        | mpeg4           | mp3  
mkv        | H.264           | ac3  
mov        | H.264           | aac  
mp4        | H.264           | aac  
mpg        | mpeg1video      | mp2  
mxf        | mpeg2video      | pcm_s16le  
wav        | -               | pcm_s16le  
```
  
Credit: [FFmprovisr Codec Defaults for FFmpeg.](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/index.html#codec-defaults)
  
It's important to specify exactly what codecs are wanted in the finished file:  

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v v210 -c:a pcm_s16le output.mov
```

---
class: contentpage
### **3.3 FFprobe**

To extract metadata from a video file you can use these commands:
```bash
ffprobe input.mov
ffprobe -hide_banner input.mov
```
You can access lots of different data from your streams using different `show` flags:  
```bash
-show_streams
-show_format
-show_packets
-show_frames
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_streams input.mov
```

A command to look at the file's video bitrate for example:   
```bash
ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=bit_rate 
-of default=noprint_wrappers=1 input.mov
```
---
class: contentpage
### **3.3 FFplay**

Most FFmpeg commands can be easily modified and run through FFplay: 
```bash
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=size=1024x576 -t 10 output.mov
ffplay -f lavfi -i testsrc=size=1024x576
```
FFplay using the same libraries used by FFmpeg and can play many formats: 
```bash
ffplay input.mov
ffplay input.jpg
ffplay input.wav
```
FFplay can also preview video with overlaid filters:  
```bash
ffplay -f lavfi "movie='input.mov', signalstats=out=brng:color=cyan[out]"
```
---
class: contentpage
### **3.4 Guides and help pages**

<font color="orange">Practise:</font> To find out more about FFmpeg look no further than their own manual (q to exit), help pages and their extensive lists of available codecs, formats, encoders, muxers, fitlers, etc.  
```bash
man ffmpeg
ffmpeg -h long / full
ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg -codecs
ffmpeg -formats
ffmpeg -muxers
ffmpeg -demuxers
ffmpeg -devices
ffmpeg -encoders
ffmpeg -decoders
ffmpeg -filters

| -g            | >=1    | Reuse context model with group of frames to improve compression    |  
| -slices       | 16, 24 | The amount of slices affects multithreading performance, file size |  
|               | 64 +   | and CRCs embedded. Increasing slices speeds encoding               |  
| -slicecrc     | 0,1    | Activates error detections check of CRCs in bitstream. 0=off, 1=on |
