This is likely the most experimental session of the course, where we use LLMs to work across the derived audio from Whisper and attempt to extract Named Entities
then link them out to Wikidata as open shared identifiers

why is this cool, it provides shared and the ability to federated 

for example "Canberra" doesn't mean anything, and may require dismabugation

eg "I like Newcastle" - newcatlse a city in australia, newcastle a city in the uk, newcastle a film from austrakia

This means that one someone says, show me everything in your collectiion they can use an dientifier to explain exactly what they mean

you can also ask a nuacned data rich questions like show me all newreals which meantion countries with less than 


start with whisper

spacy entity matching, natural language processing
as basic python example, with rendering

then with llm

entity fishing with examples and attempting wikidata 

then llm
