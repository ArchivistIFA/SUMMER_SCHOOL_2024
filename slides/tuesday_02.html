### **1. Python**

Python is a general purpose programming language from the 1980s, which is amongst one of the most popular in the world. It can be used to create all sorts of interesting things across the disciplines of data science, web development, machine learning... and archiving.

### **1.1 Why Python?**


While the command-line can be handy for simple processes, we will want to switch to a programming language to create more complex systems.

### **1.2 How Python?**

The act of writing a Python script and executing are distinct. A Python script can be written in any text editor, but we will require the Python Interpreter for it to do anything.

### **1.3 Basics: Print**

The simplest Python action is to print something:

```python
print('greeting')
```


---
class: contentpage
### **1.4 Basics: Strings**

A "string" in Python is a line of text (emojis allowed!) which Python identifies by using quotations marks (double or single are fine).

```python
print('greeting')
```

Note that if we do not use quotation marks, Python does not know that this is a line of text, and does not know what to do with it.


```python
print(greeting)
```


---
class: contentpage
### **1.5 Basics: Variables**

This is because text-without-quotations is what is known as a "variable", and is a placeholder for some other value.

```python
greeting = 'hello'
print(greeting)
```

This is very useful when we want to take a value and modify it.
```python
a_number = 1986
print(a_number)
a_number = a_number/10
print(a_number)
a_number = a_number+16
print(a_number)
a_number = a_number+a_number
print(a_number)
```

### **1.6 Basics: Types**

In Python, there is the concept of different data types, of which we have seen two: *strings* and *numbers*.

These can be identified by using the type() method.

```python
print(type('hello'))
```

Variables also inherit the type. Note Python is a "dynamic typed" language, we don't need to explicitly instruct on type, it figures it out.

```python
greeting = 'hello'
print(type(greeting))
```

Different types will behave differently, and throw an error if a logical result is not possible.

```python
a_number = 1986
print(a_number+a_number, a_number / 2)
greeting = 'hello'
print(greeting+greeting, greeting / 2)
```

### **1.7 Basics: Lists**

An important concept in Python is a list or "array". 

```python
some_people = ['paul', 'david', 'bethany', 'shana']
```

These can contain any datatype.

```python
mixed_types = ['hello', 27, 3.1415]
```



---
class: contentpage
### **1.8 Basics: For Loops**

A key concept is the "for loop", which lets us work through a list, and apply an action to each list elements

```python
for a_number in [17, 27, 37, 47]:
    print(a_number)
```
Worth noting at this point, spaces in Python matter. We need to indent the `print(person)` element with two or four spaces, so that the Python Interpreter knows what is going on!

```python
for a_number in [17, 27, 37, 47]:
    print(a_number + 4)
```

We can use this pattern to perform file operations, but first we will need to find a library to help us work with files!

### **1.9 Basics: Libraries**

Libraries are just chunks of Python code which other people wrote to do common things, and save us having to build everything from scratch.
Many useful libraries come pre-included with Python by default, but you can install others to do highly specific, or write your own!

For now, we are going to use a very useful library called Pathlib.

```python
import pathlib
for filename in ['test.wav', 'test.jpg', 'test.txt']:
    print(type(filename))
    pathlib_filename = pathlib.Path.cwd() / filename
    print(type(pathlib_filename))
    print(pathlib_filename, pathlib_filename.exists())
```

This has been a very brief introduction to Python!

### **2. IDEs**


An IDE is an environment in which we write (and sometimes can also run!) code. We **could** write a script using a basic text editor, but it is not much fun, and we will make loads of mistakes. IDEs generally come with tools to help us code better.

The most popular options for Python are Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text... there are heaps and heaps of these.

If you are looking for one to start with, I would recommend Visual Studio Code. It is easy to install and has a good balance of tools and extensibility.

If you are concerned about telemetry, there is a fork called VS Codium which has removed this component.

### **2.1 Anaconda**

Anaconda is a distribution of Python which comes with its own package management system for external libraries. It seems to be most popular with data science and machine learning projects, where managing the requirements of many different libraries can become quite tricky. I wouldn't really recommend using it unless this becomes a problem for you.

### **2.2 Jupyter**

When looking at coding in Python, you might come across mention of Jupyter and Jupyter notebooks. A Jupyter notebook is a document which comprises various blocks of text and code which can be run in any order.

As Jupyter is open source there are plenty of platforms which have "borrowed" the same concept: Google Colaboratory, Netflix Nteract, Microsoft Fabric notebooks. Visual Studio Code can also run Jupyter notebooks.

This can be quite useful for presenting reports where you want to show graphs and add additional context, and the integration of text, graphs and code is a reason why it is quite popular in science and academic contexts.

Because our focus of this course is more on functional and operational systems, we won't really be looking at Jupyter any further, but keep it in mind if you want to do data analysis reports or just have a more interactive experience with python.

### **3. Git**

What is Git? Git is one of these things which is completely ubiqutous in its domain, like Photoshop and Google.

Git is a software management system written by Linus Torvalds, who was also responsible for Linux.

It basically lets us keep track of our code, allow management of deifferent variants as they are developed and collaboration with multiple progranmemrs.

Git itself is a command line application, but there are many options for graphical interfaces. It is also built in to most modern IDEs (including Visual Studio Code).

### **4. GitHub**

GitHub is a website which allows developers to host their software projects via Git, with a lot of otehr useful features to help with keeping track of project work.

It is owned by Microsoft since it was bought in 2018. GitLab is also an equivalent platform which has some superior features, but GitHub has much more traffic.

### **5. Practical**

We are going to:

- Log into GitHub.

- Fork the `summer-school-2024` repo, which will give you your own copy.

- Clone it to your computer to work on.

- Write a script in your favourite IDE to check filesizes on our scan files.

- Use Git to commit changes back to GitHub (CLI and IDE).

- Look at GitHub issues, version control and branches.
